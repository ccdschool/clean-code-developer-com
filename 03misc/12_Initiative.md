Bracelets
---------

Clean Code Developers may expose themselves with a silicon bracelet. There is a bracelet in each color of the [CCD grades](#grades).

The bracelet is intended as a membership sign but also as a tool. It supports reflection on daily work. If a CCD recognizes that he consequently followed the principles of his current and the preceding grades, he will keep the bracelet where it is. Otherwise it switches it to the other arm. That act shapes the conscious awareness for the affected [CCD values](#values).

Naturally a CCD can use any learning tool of his or her choice – or even none. Though it would be nice, if many Clean Code Developers wore a bracelet to promote visibility of the CCD values. Thus CCD-bracelets are available at low price.
